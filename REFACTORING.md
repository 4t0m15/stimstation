# StimStation Refactoring Progress

This document outlines the refactoring progress of the StimStation project.

## Completed Steps

1. ✅ Created library crate structure
   - Set up lib.rs
   - Configured Cargo.toml for lib + binary

2. ✅ Isolated FpsCounter into core/fps.rs
   - Added tests
   - Improved documentation

3. ✅ Isolated Buffers into core/buffers.rs
   - Added tests
   - Improved documentation

4. ✅ Refactored audio modules under io/audio/
   - handler.rs: Audio analysis and spectrum generation
   - playback.rs: Audio playback with proper abstraction
   - integration.rs: Integration with visualization system
   - Replaced static mut with proper struct-based implementation

5. ✅ Split pixel utilities and rendering into render/drawing.rs
   - Created comprehensive drawing utilities
   - Added FrameBuffer struct for improved rendering

6. ✅ Created visualization adapter traits
   - Added viz/common.rs with Visualization trait
   - Added VisualizationBase for common functionality

7. ✅ Added configuration structs
   - Created utils/config.rs with proper configuration types
   - Eliminated global variables

## To-Do

1. Break up ray_pattern.rs
   - Separate sorting visualizer
   - Extract ball physics
   - Move drawing helpers to render/

2. Create and implement adapters for audio and window

3. Move visualizations into submodules

4. Update app.rs to use the new structure

5. Add proper tests for all modules

6. Apply fmt/clippy to ensure code quality

## Testing

Run tests with:
```
cargo test
```

## Development
